  abstract      = {Probabilistic models often have parameters that can be translated, scaled, permuted, or otherwise transformed without changing the model. These symmetries can lead to strong correlation and multimodality in the posterior distribution over the modelâ€™s parameters, which can pose challenges both for performing inference and interpreting the results. In this work, we address the automatic detection of common problematic model symmetries. To do so, we introduce local symmetries, which cover many common cases and are amenable to automatic detection. We show how to derive algorithms to detect several broad classes of local symmetries. Our algorithms are compatible with probabilistic programming constructs such as arrays, for loops, and if statements, and they scale to models with many variables.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian inference for the multinomial probit model, using the Gibbs sampler with data augmentation, has been recently considered by some authors. The present paper introduces a modification of the sampling technique, by defining a hybrid Markov chain in which, after each Gibbs sampling cycle, a Metropolis step is carried out along a direction of constant likelihood. Examples with simulated data sets motivate and illustrate the new technique. A proof of the ergodicity of the hybrid Markov chain is also given.
