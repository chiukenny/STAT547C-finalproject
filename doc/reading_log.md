Briefly skimmed introduction and section about latent variables. The parameterization given in section 3.2 Latent Continuous Variables in Logistic Regression is exactly one of the known models where a scaling symmetry exists?

A reparameterizations involved adding a scaling factor to improve computing performance and re-scaling to return the solution to the original parameterization. Can a similar idea be used for pre-inference breaking where a factor is added to remove symmetries, then "removed" to return to the original distribution?

## Nishihara R, et al. Detecting Parameter Symmetries in Probabilistic Models. (cont.)

Symmetries that can be written as linear combinations of the variables (matrices) are local symmetries. There is a local form of permutation symmetries.
