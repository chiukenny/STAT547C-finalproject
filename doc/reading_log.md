### Gelman A. Parameterization and Bayesian Modeling. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/parameterization.pdf

Briefly skimmed introduction and section about latent variables. The parameterization given in section 3.2 Latent Continuous Variables in Logistic Regression is exactly one of the known models where a scaling symmetry exists?

### Gelman A. Parameterization and Bayesian Modeling. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/parameterization.pdf (cont.)

A reparameterizations involved adding a scaling factor to improve computing performance and re-scaling to return the solution to the original parameterization. Can a similar idea be used for pre-inference breaking where a factor is added to remove symmetries, then "removed" to return to the original distribution?

### Nishihara R, et al. Detecting Parameter Symmetries in Probabilistic Models. (cont.)

Symmetries that can be written as linear combinations of the variables (matrices) are local symmetries. There is a local form of permutation symmetries.

Skimmed parts of this. Apparently proof was retracted then later corrected.

### Defining Functions on Equivalence Classes. https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Reports/equivclasses.pdf

Some proofs of functions defined on equivalence classes. Are any results relevant? Some notation/concepts may be useful for further development of formulation.
