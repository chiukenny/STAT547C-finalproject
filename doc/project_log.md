This project log is used to record the progress of this project.


### 2019-11-02

* Wrote project outline found in [/doc/outline-template/](https://github.com/chiukenny/kc-stat547c/tree/master/doc/outline-template)


### 2019-11-10

* Set up Infer.NET environment and followed code examples


### 2019-11-11

* Wrote scaling symmetry prototype code (currently only works with Gaussian random variables)


### 2019-11-17

* Added scratch notes in [/misc/](https://github.com/chiukenny/kc-stat547c/tree/master/misc)
* Started thinking of how to formulate symmetry breaking mathematically

### 2019-11-18 - 2019-11-19

* Preliminary mathematical definition of symmetry detection/breaking and for scaling symmetries

### 2019-11-24

* Adjusted formulation of "automatic symmetry breaker". Should have or satisfy certain properties if it breaks a symmetry.
* Question: in what cases would applying a transformation to the parameters be identical pre- and post-inference?

### 2019-11-25

* Started writing definitions in Background section
