## About this project log

This project log is used to record the progress of this project.


### 2019-11-02

* Wrote project outline found in [/doc/outline-template/](https://github.com/chiukenny/kc-stat547c/tree/master/doc/outline-template)


### 2019-11-10

* Set up Infer.NET environment and followed code examples


### 2019-11-11

* Wrote scaling symmetry prototype code (currently only works with Gaussian random variables)


### 2019-11-17

* Added scratch notes in [/misc/](https://github.com/chiukenny/kc-stat547c/tree/master/misc)
* Started thinking of how to formulate symmetry breaking mathematically

### 2019-11-18 - 2019-11-19

* Preliminary mathematical definition of symmetry detection/breaking and for scaling symmetries

### 2019-11-24

* Adjusted formulation of "automatic symmetry breaker". Should have or satisfy certain properties if it breaks a symmetry.
* Question: in what cases would applying a transformation to the parameters be identical pre- and post-inference?

### 2019-11-25

* Started writing definitions in Background section

### 2019-11-26

* Started writing new definitions in body
* Thought of reparameterization as adding factors with constraints to remove symmetries. Can this be done without changing the likelihood?

### 2019-11-27

* Added example of a detector for scaling symmetries

### 2019-12-04

* Added background and equivalence class formulation for permutation symmetries
* Started writing formulation based on reparameterization section in body

### 2019-12-06

* Added introduction and context and edited previous notes

### 2019-12-07

* Completed draft of background and body.
* Added one exercise.

### 2019-12-08

* Completed draft of report.

### 2019-12-09

* Revised report.
* Found error in proof of one exercise. Need to replace with another.
